            <h2>How to Play Chess Conquest</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Chess Conquest, a strategic game where you compete to either capture the opponent's king or conquer the central hill!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Win by capturing the opponent's king or holding the central hill (yellow square) for 45 seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>Moving Pieces:</strong> Click a piece to select it (green highlight), then click a highlighted square to move. You can deselect by clicking the piece again.</li>
                <li><strong>Piece Movement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves 1 square in any direction (up, down, left, right) or diagonally to capture.</li>
                        <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an L-shape (2 squares in one direction, 1 square perpendicular).</li>
                        <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Moves diagonally up to 5 squares.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Moves horizontally or vertically up to 5 squares.</li>
                        <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Moves in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) up to 5 squares.</li>
                        <li><strong>King:</strong> Moves 1 square in any direction.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cooldowns:</strong> After moving, pieces have a cooldown: 5 seconds on grass (light green), 10 seconds on forest (dark green). You cannot move a piece until its cooldown ends (red overlay fades).</li>
                <li><strong>Hill Conquest:</strong> Move a piece onto the central hill (yellow square) and hold it for 45 seconds to win. The hill timer is displayed on the hill and in the progress bar.</li>
                <li><strong>Inactivity Timeout:</strong> You must move a piece within 90 seconds, or you lose the game. Timers for each team are displayed (e.g., "Team 0: 90s | Team 1: 90s").</li>
                <li><strong>Queue System:</strong> Only one game can be active at a time. If a game is ongoing, you’ll be placed in a queue. The queue size is displayed (e.g., "Players in queue: 0").</li>
                <li><strong>Spectator Mode:</strong> If you’re in the queue, you can spectate the current game but cannot interact.</li>
                <li><strong>Shrines:</strong> Gray squares are shrines. Moving onto a shrine has a 20% chance to delete the piece and an 80% chance to duplicate it to the right (if space is available).</li>
                <li><strong>Winning:</strong> Win by capturing the opponent’s king or holding the hill for 45 seconds. The winner receives 0.005 SOL!</li>
